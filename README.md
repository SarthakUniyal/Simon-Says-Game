Simon Says is a memory-based color sequence game where players must watch and repeat an ever-growing pattern of flashing buttons. Each round adds a new color to the sequence, challenging your focus and recall. The game starts when you press any key on your keyboard and continues until you make a mistake. Designed for desktop use, it requires a physical keyboard to begin and may not function on mobile devices. The goal is simple: follow the pattern as long as you can and see how far your memory can take you!
